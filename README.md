Open-source linguistic computational phylogenetics.

Goals for this project:
- Always 100% free for academics and hobbyists.
- Easy and clean software to compare the geneological relationship of languages.
- Multiple glottochronological models (Bayesian, Parsimonious, etc.)
- Parsimony based on both place and manner, as well as common cross-linguistic sound changes.
- Multiple sets of data types (lexicon, cognates, grammatical features, morphemes, phonology, etc.)
- Reasonably resistant to word borrowings.
- Predicting features of most recent common ancestors (not complete linguistic reconstruction, just features)
- Manual sets of synonyms or near-synonyms to auto-identify cognates.
